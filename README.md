First Person Template
=====================

What is this?
-------------
The First Person Template is a bare-bones first person template object for use with the Blender Game Engine. It's basically two files, or three parts
*	The script FPcontrols.py, which contains all the modules Blender needs
*	The .blend FPcontrols.blend, which has the Player and PlayerCam objects, as well as a little test scene to run around in

How do I use it?
----------------
Just link Player and PlayerCam from FPcontrols.blend to your project, make them both local so you can edit the various properties of the Player, and have at it!

Any standard controls?
----------------------
Yup! Keys are mapped as such:
*	W/A/S/D - Move around
*	Mouse - Look
*	Space - Jump
*	Shift - Sprint (or walk slowly; it triggers a speed multiplier)

Everything in this is free for use in whatever you like, just show me what you use it in so I can check it out! I'm always looking for new fun stuff to try out.
